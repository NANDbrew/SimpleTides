# SimpleTides

A quick test using Buen's idea of moving the islands up and down to simulate tides.

By default this goes up/down 1 meter from the standard water level.
Be careful to put your character on a boat or in the water before activating this mod; because it moves the land up and down you might end up underground otherwise.



Settings:
 - Antipodal tides: two high tides per day
 - Manual settings: use settings below. otherwise use built-in region/island specific values
 - Magnitude: total variation in meters between high and low tides (default 2)
 - Offset: midpoint offset from normal water level (default 0)
